# ucf webcams for Glass

UCF has a stream of public webcams:

http://webcams.sdes.ucf.edu/

As an experiment with Glass and CardViewAdapter with webviews, I put together this example.

It's relatively simple; just puts together some WebViews you can scroll through, and adds image tags pointing to the motion JPEGs in them. No data is scarped or harvested, and if you're worried about the creep factor, these cams are degraded intentionally to protect privacy. They're primarily useful for checking weather or seeing which parts of campus are currently crowded.

Public domain, feel free to tinker with it!
